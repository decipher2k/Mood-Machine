# Mood-Machine
Mood Machine is ment to change your dominant brain frequencies to those described in the different programs.<br>
It is based on binaural beats. Two different frequencies are applied to the each ear.<br>
According to the binaural beats theory, the brain's dominant operational frequency gets modified to match the difference of both frequencies. In addition, the two brain halfes may be synced.<br>
